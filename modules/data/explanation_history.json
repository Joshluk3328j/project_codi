The calculated age is then printed out. However, there is a syntax error in the code. The input function call is not closed properly with a parenthesis. Here's the corrected code:\n\nbirth_year = int(input(\"what year were you born? \"))\nage = 2025 - birth_year\nprint(f\"you are {age} years old\")\n\nIn this corrected code, the input function call is closed with a parenthesis, and the code should run without any errors."
